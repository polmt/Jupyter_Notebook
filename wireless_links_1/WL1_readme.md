#### 1)
Consider an electromagnetic wave with frequency 10α+2 Hz which propagates in free space and has electric field amplitude \( E_x = 0.5(b+1) \) V/m. Calculate:

(a) Its phase velocity, wavelength, and propagation constant.

(b) The characteristic impedance of the propagation medium.

(c) The amplitude of the magnetic field.

(d) Design the polarization of the wave.

(e) What polarization and what length should an antenna have to receive or transmit this signal?

(f) In which frequency band does this wave belong, what type of communications would you use it for, and why?

The calculations requested in the first three questions should also be done in the case where the wave propagates in a lossless medium with relative permittivity ε_r = 4 and relative permeability μ_r = 1.




#### 2)
Consider a telecommunication satellite system (point-to-point with passive reflectors and assuming that the propagation losses can be neglected) that uses a spherical passive satellite with effective cross-sectional area of \( (5+a) \) m\(^2\). The gain of the transmitting antenna is \( GT = 20b \) dB, the gain of the receiving antenna is \( GR = 2(a+1) \) dB, and the operating frequency is \( f = 5 \) GHz. The transmitted power is 100/(b+1) kW, and the temperature of the receiving antenna is 25 K. The distances of the transmitting and receiving antennas from the receiver are \( d1 = (2000+10a) \) m and \( d2 = (200+1000b) \) m, respectively. Calculate:

(a) The signal-to-noise ratio at the input of the receiver, if the receiver bandwidth is (a+1) kHz.

(b) At what distance should we position the receiver, without changing any other element of the system, in order to double the signal-to-noise ratio at the input of the receiver (in dB) compared to what was calculated in the previous step?

(c) For the \( d2 \) calculated in part b, if we don't change anything else in the system, what should be the minimum transmitting power to achieve a double signal-to-noise ratio at the input of the receiver (in dB) compared to what was calculated in part a?




#### 3)
A RADAR operates at a frequency of 3 GHz with a transmitted power of 2.1 kW and a gain of 35 dB. What should be the sensitivity (in dBm) of the RADAR so that it can detect aircraft with a radar cross-section of \( \sigma = 40 \) square meters at distances ranging from 40 to 60 miles?


Create a sensitivity diagram for this specific RADAR system as a function of the distance of the aircraft. If the minimum sensitivity of the RADAR according to its manufacturer is -100 dBm, what is the maximum distance it can detect the aforementioned objects?
