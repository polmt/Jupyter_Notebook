#### 1)
In a radio system, there is a peaky obstacle at a distance \( d1 = (15+0.1a) \) km from the transmitting antenna. The optical axis of the system passes just below the top of the obstacle at a height \( h = (60+0.1a) \) m. The minimum distance of the system is \( d = (60+0.1a) \) km, the operating frequency is 500 MHz, and the gains of the transmitting and receiving antennas are \( GT = (15+0.1b) \) dB and \( GR = (18+0.1b) \) dB, respectively, and the received power is 1.5 nW. Calculate the transmitted power.

For the value of \( b \) corresponding to the last digit of our AM, graphically represent, on orthogonal coordinate axes, the variation of the transmitted power with \( a \). The values of \( a \) that should be displayed are from 0 to 10 with unit steps.

#### 2)
In a radio system, the transmitter is located at a height \( h_T = (50+0.1a) \) m and the receiver at a height \( h_R = (75-0.1a) \) m. The distance between them is \( d = (55+0.1a) \) km, and the operating frequency is 1 GHz. The transmitter emits with a power of 100W, and the transmitting and receiving antennas have gains \( GT = 150 \) and \( GR = 170 \) respectively. Between the transmitter and the receiver, at a distance of \( d1 = (25-0.1a) \) km from the transmitter, there is a peaky obstacle whose optical axis is at a height of \( (200-0.1a) \) m from the top. The prevailing meteorological conditions are either those of the standard atmosphere for 80% of the system's operating time or those of substandard atmosphere (K=1) for the remaining 20% of the system's operating time. Calculate the received power and its two cases, and the average received power for 100% of the system's operating time.

Graphically represent, on orthogonal coordinate axes, the variation of the received power with \( a \). The values of \( a \) to be displayed should range from 0 to 10 with unit steps.
